# Boost (docs.boostsecurity.io) is a tool used by Product Security to aggregate
# results from various security tools (e.g., Brakeman, Semgrep, etc.), and to
# provide in-context comments on PRs.
#
# Additionally, Boost optimizes tool runtime by scanning only modified files
# (where appropriate) on PR runs.
#
# This file - written in the .gitignore syntax - tells Boost what files to
# always retain when preparing the working directory for a diff-scan.
# Scripts used to run tools:
bin/**/*
# Configuration for tools:
config/**/*
